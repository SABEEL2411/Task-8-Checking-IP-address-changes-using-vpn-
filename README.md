# VPN Interview Questions & Answers

## 1️⃣ What is a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a secure tunnel between your device and the internet. It encrypts your internet traffic and hides your IP address, making your online activities more private and secure.

---

## 2️⃣ How does a VPN protect privacy?

A VPN encrypts your internet data, preventing ISPs, hackers, and third parties from tracking your browsing activities. It also masks your IP address, making it harder for websites to identify your location and identity.

---

## 3️⃣ Difference between VPN and proxy?

- **VPN:** Encrypts all traffic between your device and the internet, including all apps and browsers.  
- **Proxy:** Routes only specific application traffic (e.g., browser) without encrypting it.  
- VPNs offer better security and privacy compared to proxies.

## 4️⃣ What is encryption in VPN?

Encryption in a VPN scrambles your internet data into an unreadable format using algorithms like AES-256. This ensures that even if someone intercepts the traffic, they cannot read or misuse it.

---

## 5️⃣ Can VPN guarantee complete anonymity?

No, a VPN does not guarantee complete anonymity. While it hides your IP address and encrypts your traffic, your activities may still be linked to your online accounts if you log in. Also, some VPN providers may keep logs.

---

## 6️⃣ What protocols do VPNs use?

Common VPN protocols include:  
- **OpenVPN**: Open-source, secure, widely used.  
- **WireGuard**: Modern, fast, efficient.  
- **IKEv2/IPSec**: Good for mobile devices and stable connections.  
- **L2TP/IPSec**: Older but still used in some scenarios.

---

## 7️⃣ What are some VPN limitations?

- Slower speeds due to encryption and rerouting.  
- May not bypass all region-restricted content.  
- Some VPNs keep logs, reducing privacy.  
- Not foolproof against malware or phishing attacks.

---

## 8️⃣ How does a VPN affect network speed?

Using a VPN can slow down your connection because:  
- Data travels through a VPN server, adding latency.  
- Encryption processes add overhead.  
- The further the server location, the higher the delay.  
However, reputable VPNs optimize servers to minimize these speed reductions.
